## Project Title
Creating my portfolio for challeneg 2 of U of O's coding bootcmap

## Description
This project focused on creating HTML and CSS attributes for my person portfolio website. I build the HTML and CSS from the ground up to include functioning links, a current phorto of myself, a portfolio section, an About Me section, and a Contact section. 

## Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## How Critera was Met
Building functioning HTML and CSS pages by utilizing in class and out of class resources to make sure links function corrently, the page can be functionable regardless fo screen size, and creating clear sectionings to keep the code organized.
